    "#### Google Sunroof Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the price of installing solar has gotten less expensive, more homeowners are turning to it as a possible option for decreasing their energy bill. We want to make installing solar panels easy and understandable for anyone. Project Sunroof puts Google's expansive data in mapping and computing resources to use, helping calculate the best solar plan for you. Project Sunroof computes how much sunlight hits your roof in a year. It takes into account: Google's database of imagery and maps 3D modeling of your roof Shadows cast by nearby structures and trees All possible sun positions over the course of a year Historical cloud and temperature patterns that might affect solar energy production. Data is available state wise, city wise, county wise, census wise on https://www.google.com/get/sunroof. I have used state and city data for my analysis.\n",

    "A carbon offset is an investment in an activity that reduces carbon emissions. The reduction in carbon emissions is represented by a carbon credit. The credit, usually verified by a third party, signifies that greenhouse gas emissions are lower than they would have been had no one invested in the offset. One credit equals one metric ton of carbon dioxide prevented from entering the atmosphere. The credit purchaser can use the credit for carbon accounting. l we can power our operations entirely with renewables or reduce our emissions in other ways, we can use the offsets to fund projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, indirectly reducing our total carbon footprint. When we apply that credit to our carbon footprint, it offsets our emissions from using non-renewable energy.\n",

    "The following plot shows the ranges of the solar panel system available in the top three states with maximum carbon offset potential regions. When the maximum solar panels are installed irrespective of the solar panel sizes, the carbon offset is possible. Depending upon the data from google, we have the following bins of solar panels. These are just top three states, if we consider installation of solar panel in entire USA, the carbon offset potential will surely increase. For the top three states, the maximum solar panels can be installed in 1 - 5 mW ranges."
